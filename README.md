## Background <a name="background"></a>

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success. 

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success.

In this Repo we organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transform the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. 

# Final Production Database
Uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database a relational database management system.

## Data Sources <a name="data"></a>
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
 1.  contacts.xlsx
 2.  crowdfunding.xlsx

## Findings and Conclusions <a name="findings"></a>
The following findings and conclusions from the analysis are as follows:

 1.  ### Outcome of Campaigns
      Looking at the overall data set, the majority of campaigns were successful (56.5%), followed by failed campaigns (36.4%), and canceled campaigns (5.7%). At basic level this data is encouraging to future campaings to see that the majority of campaigns were successful. Further analysis will show which categories are most successful and which categories are least successful.

 2. ### Average Goal Amount for Campaigns
      The average goal amount for all campaigns was $43,983. The average goal amount for successful campaigns was only $26,405, while the average goal amount for failed campaigns was $65,404. The average goal amount for canceled campaigns was $70,747.

</p>
      Based on these observations, it appears that the lower the goal amount, the more likely the campaign will be successful. This could be useful for future campaings to focus crowdfunding efforts on smaller, more focused goals to increase the likelihood of success. From a project management perspective, this could also be useful to plan to complete a larger project in chunks, rather than trying to complete the entire project at once.   
 
 3.  ### Percentage of Successful Campaigns by Category
      The most successful category was 'Journalsim' with 100% of campaigns being successful. The least successful category was "Games" with only 44.0% of campaigns being successful. The second most successful category was "Technology" with 67.0% of campaigns being successful. There is likely a correlation between the average goal amount and the percentage of successful campaigns.

</p>

      The following chart confirms that the a very high average goal amount negatively impacts the chances for a successful campaign. The 'Games' category, on average, has the highest goal amount of all categories, at $59,542. While the average goal amount for the 'Journalism' category is the lowest of all categories, at $6,425.

## Part 1: A Category and Subcategory DataFrame is Created <a name="part-1"></a>
Extracting and Transforming 
  1. Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a category DataFrame that has the following columns:
    -  A "category_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "cat1" to "catn", where n is the number of unique       categories
    -  A "category" column that contains only the category titles
  2. Export the category DataFrame as category.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.
  3. Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a subcategory DataFrame that has the following columns:
      -  A "subcategory_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "subcat1" to "subcatn", where n is the number of   unique subcategories              
      -  A "subcategory" column that contains only the subcategory titles
  4.  Export the subcategory DataFrame as subcategory.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.

## Part 2: A Campaign DataFrame is Created <a name="part-2"></a>
Extracting and Transforming 
1. Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a campaign DataFrame has the following columns:
      -  The "cf_id" column
      -  The "contact_id" column
      -  The "company_name" column
      -  The "blurb" column, renamed to "description"
      -  The "goal" column, converted to the float data type
      -  The "pledged" column, converted to the float data type
      -  The "outcome" column
      -  The "backers_count" column
      -  The "country" column
      -  The "currency" column
      -  The "launched_at" column, renamed to "launch_date" and with the UTC times converted to the datetime format
      -  The "deadline" column, renamed to "end_date" and with the UTC times converted to the datetime format
      -  The "category_id" column, with unique identification numbers matching those in the "category_id" column of the category DataFrame
      -  The "subcategory_id" column, with the unique identification numbers matching those in the "subcategory_id" column of the subcategory DataFrame
2. Export the campaign DataFrame as campaign.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.

## Part 3: A Contacts DataFrame is Created <a name="part-3"></a>
Extracting and Transforming 
1. For extracting and transforming the data from the contacts.xlsx Excel data:
      -  Use Python dictionary methods.
    
2. Complete the following steps:
      -  Import the contacts.xlsx file into a DataFrame.
      -  Iterate through the DataFrame, converting each row to a dictionary.
      -  Iterate through each dictionary, doing the following:
         -  Extract the dictionary values from the keys by using a Python list comprehension.
         -  Add the values for each row to a new list.
      -  Create a new DataFrame that contains the extracted data.
      -  Split each "name" column value into a first and last name, and place each in a new column. 
      -  Clean and export the DataFrame as contacts.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.

## Part 4: A Crowdfunding Database is Created <a name="part-4"></a>
Load
1. Inspect the four CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD
2. Use the information from the ERD to create a table schema for each CSV file.
    -  Note: Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
3. Save the database schema as a Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, and save it to your GitHub repository.
4. Create a new Postgres database, named crowdfunding_db.
5. Using the database schema, create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
6. Verify the table creation by running a SELECT statement for each table.
7. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
8. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
